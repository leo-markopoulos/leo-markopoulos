ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Leo Markopoulos!
I'm passionate about Machine Learning and exploring how Logical Reasoning can be integrated into computer science applications. I work on a variety of tasks within these domains, ranging from algorithm development to optimizing real-world systems.

ðŸ”§ Key Areas of Focus:

Machine Learning: Supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Language models, sentiment analysis, text generation
Computer Vision: Image recognition, object detection, and segmentation
Reinforcement Learning: Building intelligent agents for decision-making problems
Data Structures and Algorithms: Optimizing performance and memory in problem-solving
Formal Logic: Applying logical frameworks to computational models, theorem proving
Automated Reasoning: Designing systems that mimic human-like logical thought processes
Distributed Systems: Designing scalable, fault-tolerant systems for large-scale applications
Algorithm Design and Optimization: Tackling complex optimization and search problems in AI
ðŸ’» Currently experimenting with:

Implementing deep learning algorithms for complex prediction tasks
Solving combinatorial problems using logical algorithms
Exploring AI ethics and explainability in machine learning models
ðŸ”— Let's collaborate on projects that involve the intersection of AI, logic, and advanced algorithms!
